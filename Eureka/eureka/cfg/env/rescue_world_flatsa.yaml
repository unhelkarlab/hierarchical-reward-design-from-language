  Task description: 
  The task objective is to deliver all objects on the map.
  In the task reward, the agent gets a reward of +30 when it successfully delivers an object,
  and a step cost of -1 for each time step taken.
  The reward function you write does not need to encode the task objective. 

  Relevant task spaces:
  The agent's action (referred to as LL_Action in the code) space consists of moving in the four cardinal directions, as well as atomic actions pick and drop.
  The agent can only perform LL_Action "pick" if it is at the same location as the object.

  User preference:
  The agent should pick up an object type that's the same as the previously delivered object type, 
  if there are still objects of that type remaining in the environment.
  Otherwise, the agent should pick up an object of a different type.
  In addition, the agent should avoid yellow danger zones when it is delivering an object.
  However, the agent does not need to avoid danger zones when it is going to an object.
  
  Additional info: 
  You need to write a reward function to encode this user preference.
  The preference function you write will be used together with the task reward to train the agent.
  Please make sure NOT to make the reward function stateful (i.e. you should not use function attributes or global variables.)
  You should also not write any other helper functions.
