  Task description: 
  The task objective is to pick up all apples and eggs on the dining table and place them in the sink.
  In the task reward, the agent gets a reward of +10 after it successfully picks up an object and places it in the sink,
  and a step cost of -0.1 for each time step taken.
  The reward function you write does not need to encode the task objective. 

  Relevant task spaces:
  The agent's option/subtask (referred to as self.pnp_hl_actions in the code) space consists of picking up and placing the two types of objects.
  Each option takes multiple action steps to complete. 
  Taking a 'pick' option means that the agent will navigate to an object and pick it up.
  Taking a 'place' option means that the agent will navigate to the delivery location and place the object there.
  Note that the agent has to first go to the object to pick it up before placing the object.

  The agent's action (referred to as self.pnp_ll_actions in the code) space consists of the primitives for:
  moving forward, rotating left, rotating right, picking up the closest object, and placing a held object in receptacle.
  The agent can only perform the low level pick or place primitive only if the agent is close enough to an object or a receptacle.

  User preference:
  The agent should avoid the stool in the environment both when it is on its way to pick up an egg and place an egg down.
  More specifically, the agent should be penalized when it is within 1.5 meters of the stool.
  However, the agent does not need to avoid the stool when it is on its way to pick up an apple or place an apple down.

  Additional info: 
  You need to write a reward function to encode this user preference.
  The preference function you write will be used together with the task reward to train the agent.
  Please make sure NOT to make the reward function stateful (i.e. you should not use function attributes or global variables.)
  You should also not write any other helper functions.
