  Task description: 
  The task objective is to pick up all apples and eggs on the dining table and place them in the sink.
  In the task reward, the agent gets a reward of +10 after it successfully picks up an object and places it in the sink,
  and a step cost of -0.1 for each time step taken.
  The reward function you write does not need to encode the task objective. 

  Relevant task spaces:
  The agent's action (referred to as self.pnp_ll_actions in the code) space consists of the primitives for:
  moving forward, rotating left, rotating right, picking up the closest object, and placing a held object in receptacle.
  The agent can only perform the low level pick or place primitive only if the agent is close enough to an object or a receptacle.

  User preference:
  The agent should avoid the stool in the environment both when it is on its way to pick up an egg and place an egg down.
  More specifically, the agent should be penalized when it is within 1.5 meters of the stool.
  However, the agent does not need to avoid the stool when it is on its way to pick up an apple or place an apple down.

  In addition, the agent should pick up an object type that's different from the previously placed object type, 
  as long as there are objects of the other type on the table need to be picked.

  Additional info: 
  You need to write a reward function to encode this user preference.
  The preference function you write will be used together with the task reward to train the agent.
  It can take up to 30 steps to reach an object and pick it up, or to reach the sink and drop it off.
  Make sure your reward scaling gives the preference for alternating objects much more weight than the negative step rewards, 
  but still lower than the positive task reward.
  Please make sure NOT to make the reward function stateful (i.e. you should not use function attributes or global variables.)
  You should also not write any other helper functions.
