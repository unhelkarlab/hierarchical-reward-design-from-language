  Task description: 
  The task objective is to prepare one David's salad with three ingredients: onion, lettuce, and tomatoes. 
  To make this salad, the agent needs to:
    a. Chop ingredients (onion, lettuce, and tomatoes). 
       Only one ingredient of each type is needed to complete the salad. 
    b. Combined chopped ingredients. 
    c. Plate the salad.
  The task reward already encodes the task objective.
  In the task rewrd, the agent receives a reward of +1 when it completes a salad, and a step cost of -0.01 for each time step taken.
  The reward function you write does not need to encode the task objective.  

  Relevant task spaces:
  The agent's action (low-level action) space consists of moving in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and idle.
  When an agent is standing next to a counter, performing an action in the direction of the counter interacts with the counter.
  
  User preference:
  The agent should chop an onion after it chops a tomato, and the agent should chop a lettuce after it chops an onion.
  If the ingredients are already chopped or a combined salad already exists, the agent should not chop more ingredients.
  The mixing order of the ingredients does not matter.

  Additional info: 
  You need to write a reward function to encode this user preference.
  The preference function you write will be used together with the task reward to train the agent.
  Please make sure NOT to make the reward function stateful (i.e. you should not use function attributes or global variables.)
  You should also not write any other helper functions.
